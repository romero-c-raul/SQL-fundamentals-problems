Does the following statement use the Data Definition Language (DDL) or the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of SQL?

`SELECT column_name FROM my_table;`

This statement is part of the DML. DML is concerned with creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. SELECT is synonymous with READ.
